Note: this theme uses your terminal emulator's colors, so they may look different in your setup.

In the prompt, you will find:

- If your last command has failed, as the dragon will spit fire.
- If you have sourced a virtual environment, its base name.
- Your current directory with parent directories abbreviated by their initials.
- If inside a Git repository, the active branch and the latest tag.
