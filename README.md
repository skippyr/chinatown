# Chinatown

## Starting Point

The Chinatown project is a dual-line theme for the ZSH shell with a dragon emoji
and flames decorators that uses a powerline style. Its style is inspired by the
popular [Agnoster theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme).

This theme can be setup with a series of terminal emulators, themes and
wallpapers. You can use following preview as a source of inspiration and
reference to see what it can look like:

> In this preview, the Chinatown was used within the [Kitty terminal emulator](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
with the [Twilight theme](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes/blob/master/themes/Twilight.conf).
Font used is [IntelOne Mono (Medium)](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono)
with fallback to Nerd Fonts Symbols. Wallpaper is [Landscape photography of waterfalls by Yeo Yonghwan](https://unsplash.com/photos/sS7P1h4Modg) from Unsplash.
